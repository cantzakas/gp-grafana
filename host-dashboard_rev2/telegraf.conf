# Telegraf Configuration
#
# Telegraf is entirely plugin driven. All metrics are gathered from the declared inputs, and sent to the declared outputs.
#
# Plugins must be declared in here to be active. To deactivate a plugin, comment out the name and any variables.
#
# Use 'telegraf -config telegraf.conf -test' to see what metrics a config file would generate.
#
# Environment variables can be used anywhere in this config file, simply surround them with ${}. For strings the variable must be within quotes (ie, "${STR_VAR}"), for numbers and booleans they should be plain (ie, ${INT_VAR}, ${BOOL_VAR})

# Global tags can be specified here in key="value" format.
[global_tags]

# Configuration for telegraf agent
[agent]
  ## Default data collection interval for all inputs
  interval = "10s"
  ## Rounds collection interval to 'interval' ie, if interval="10s" then always collect on :00, :10, :20, etc.
  round_interval = true

  ## Telegraf will send metrics to outputs in batches of at most metric_batch_size metrics. This controls the size of writes that Telegraf sends to output plugins.
  metric_batch_size = 1000

  ## Maximum number of unwritten metrics per output.
  metric_buffer_limit = 10000

  ## Collection jitter is used to jitter the collection by a random amount. Each plugin will sleep for a random time within jitter before collecting. This can be used to avoid many plugins querying things like sysfs at the same time, which can have a measurable effect on the system.
  collection_jitter = "0s"

  ## Default flushing interval for all outputs. Maximum flush_interval will be flush_interval + flush_jitter
  flush_interval = "10s"
  ## Jitter the flush interval by a random amount. This is primarily to avoid large write spikes for users running a large number of telegraf instances. ie, a jitter of 5s and interval 10s means flushes will happen every 10-15s
  flush_jitter = "0s"

  ## By default or when set to "0s", precision will be set to the same timestamp order as the collection interval, with the maximum being 1s. ie, when interval = "10s", precision will be "1s", when interval = "250ms", precision will be "1ms". Precision will NOT be used for service inputs. It is up to each individual service input to set the timestamp at the appropriate precision. Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s".
  precision = ""

  ## Override default hostname, if empty use os.Hostname()
  hostname = ""
  ## If set to true, do no set the "host" tag in the telegraf agent.
